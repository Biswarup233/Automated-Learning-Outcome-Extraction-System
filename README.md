# Automated-Learning-Outcome-Extraction-System
Automated Learning Outcome Extraction System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a state-of-the-art technology that enables the extraction of relevant learning outcomes from educational texts. Learning outcomes are statements that describe the knowledge, skills, and competencies that learners are expected to acquire upon completion of an educational program. They are important for ensuring that educational programs are effective and meet the needs of learners and employers.
Bloom Taxonomy
Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical framework that categorizes educational objectives and learning outcomes. It was originally developed by Benjamin Bloom in the 1950s and has since been revised and expanded upon by other educators. The taxonomy classifies cognitive processes into six levels, arranged in increasing complexity:

Knowledge: This level involves the recall and recognition of information. It includes remembering facts, terms, concepts, or details.

Comprehension: This level focuses on understanding and interpreting information. It involves grasping the meaning of concepts, organizing ideas, and translating information into one's own words.

Application: At this level, learners apply their knowledge and understanding to solve problems or complete tasks. It involves using acquired knowledge in new and practical situations.

Analysis: This level involves breaking down complex concepts into smaller parts and examining their relationships. It includes identifying patterns, making inferences, and drawing conclusions.

Synthesis: At this level, learners combine different ideas, concepts, or information to create something new. It involves generating hypotheses, designing experiments, or creating original works.

Evaluation: The highest level of Bloom's Taxonomy involves making judgments or assessments based on criteria or standards. It includes evaluating the reliability of sources, critiquing arguments, or making informed decisions.
